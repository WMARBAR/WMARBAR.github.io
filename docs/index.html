                    I was born on April 18, 1995, and I am an electronic engineer passionate about programming, always seeking innovative solutions.
                    I enjoy reading and writingâ€”activities that nurture my creativity and allow me to explore ideas beyond the technical realm.
                    Additionally, I have five years of experience working with various types of databases, which has enabled me to develop analytical and technical skills to transform data into practical solutions.

                    My journey in the world of data analysis began with Excel, where I learned to efficiently handle and organize information, laying the foundation for my development in this field.
                    Later, I delved deeper into R, a language that allowed me to explore advanced statistical analysis and create powerful data visualizations.
                    However, it was with Python that I found my true passion.
                    Its versatility, simplicity, and power captivated me, making it my favorite tool to solve complex problems, automate processes, and create innovative solutions in the data world.

                    I never stop learning.
                    In addition to my engineering studies, I complement my education with courses on online learning platforms such as Udemy and Platzi.
                    I am also an avid reader of technical and personal development books, which allows me to delve into specialized topics and gain new perspectives that enrich both my professional life and my worldview.
                    This commitment to continuous learning helps me stay up to date, innovate, and grow in every aspect of my life.

                <p>
                    When it comes to my personal interests, I am passionate about rock, metal, and classical music. My all-time favorite band is Gamma Ray, which has topped my Spotify list for the past two years.
                    In cinema, Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs holds a special place as my favorite movie.
                    In literature, I enjoy deep and thought-provoking works. Books like Crime and Punishment, 1984, and The Kybalion have profoundly impacted me, offering unique perspectives on human nature, society, and spirituality.
